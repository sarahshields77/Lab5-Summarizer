UN Environment Programme 21 Sep 2024 Story Environment under review
AI has an environmental problem. Here’s what the world can do about that.
There are high hopes that artificial intelligence (AI) can help tackle some of the world’s biggest environmental emergencies. Among other things, the technology is already being used to map the destructive dredging of sand and chart emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.  

But when it comes to the environment, there is a negative side to the explosion of AI and its associated infrastructure, according to a growing body of research. The proliferating data centres that house AI servers produce electronic waste. They are large consumers of water, which is becoming scarce in many places. They rely on critical minerals and rare elements, which are often mined unsustainably. And they use massive amounts of electricity, spurring the emission of planet-warming greenhouse gases.  

“There is still much we don’t know about the environmental impact of AI but some of the data we do have is concerning,” said Golestan (Sally) Radwan, the Chief Digital Officer of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). “We need to make sure the net effect of AI on the planet is positive before we deploy the technology at scale.”  

This week, UNEP released an issue note that explores AI’s environmental footprint and considers how the technology can be rolled out sustainably. It follows a major UNEP report, Navigating New Horizons, which also examined AI’s promise and perils. Here’s what those publications found. 

First of all, what is AI? 

AI is a catch-all term for a group of technologies that can process information and, at least superficially, mimic human thinking. Rudimentary forms of AI have been around since the 1950s. But the technology has evolved at a breakneck pace in recent years, in part because of advances in computing power and the explosion of data, which is crucial for training AI models. 

Why are people excited about the potential of AI when it comes to the environment? 

The big benefit of AI is that it can detect patterns in data, such as anomalies and similarities, and use historic knowledge to accurately predict future outcomes. That could make AI invaluable for monitoring the environment, and helping governments, businesses and individuals make more planet-friendly choices. It can also enhance efficiencies. UNEP, for example, uses AI to detect when oil and gas installations vent methane, a greenhouse gas that drives climate change.  

Advances like those are fostering hope that AI could help the world tackle at least some aspects of the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste. 

So how is AI problematic for the environment? 

Most large-scale AI deployments are housed in data centres, including those operated by cloud service providers. These data centres can take a heavy toll on the planet. The electronics they house rely on a staggering amount of grist: making a 2 kg computer requires 800 kg of raw materials. As well, the microchips that power AI need rare earth elements, which are often mined in environmentally destructive ways, noted Navigating New Horizons.  

The second problem is that data centres produce electronic waste, which often contains hazardous substances, like mercury and lead.  

Third, data centres use water during construction and, once operational, to cool electrical components. Globally, AI-related infrastructure may soon consume six times more water than Denmark, a country of 6 million, according to one estimate. That is a problem when a quarter of humanity already lacks access to clean water and sanitation.  

Finally, to power their complex electronics, data centres that host AI technology need a lot of energy, which in most places still comes from the burning of fossil fuels, producing planet-warming greenhouse gases. A request made through ChatGPT, an AI-based virtual assistant, consumes 10 times the electricity of a Google Search, reported the International Energy Agency. While global data is sparse, the agency estimates that in the tech hub of Ireland, the rise of AI could see data centres account for nearly 35 per cent of the country’s energy use by 2026.  

Driven in part by the explosion of AI, the number of data centres has surged to 8 million from 500,000 in 2012, and experts expect the technology’s demands on the planet to keep growing. 

Some have said that when it comes to the environment, AI is a wildcard. Why is that?  

We have a decent handle on what the environmental impacts of data centres could be. But it’s impossible to predict how AI-based applications themselves will affect the planet. Some experts worry they may have unintended consequences. For example, the development of AI-powered self-driving cars could cause more people to drive instead of cycling or taking public transit, pushing up greenhouse gas emissions. Then there are what experts call higher-order effects. AI, for example, could be used to generate misinformation about climate change, downplaying the threat in the eyes of the public. 

Is anybody doing anything about the environmental impacts of AI? 

More than 190 countries have adopted a series of non-binding recommendations on the ethical use of AI, which covers the environment. As well, both the European Union and the United States of America have introduced legislation to temper the environmental impact of AI. But policies like those are few and far between, says Radwan. 

“Governments are racing to develop national AI strategies but rarely do they take the environment and sustainability into account. The lack of environmental guardrails is no less dangerous than the lack of other AI-related safeguards.” 

How can the world rein in the environmental fallout from AI? 

In the new issue note, UNEP recommends five main things. Firstly, countries can establish standardized procedures for measuring the environmental impact of AI; right now, there’s a dearth of reliable information on the subject. Secondly, with support from UNEP, governments can develop regulations that require companies to disclose the direct environmental consequences of AI-based products and services. Thirdly, tech companies can make AI algorithms more efficient, reducing their demand for energy, while recycling water and reusing components where feasible. Fourthly, countries can encourage companies to green their data centres, including by using renewable energy and offsetting their carbon emissions. Finally, countries can weave their AI-related policies into their broader environmental regulations. 

UNEP is focused on helping the world better navigate the environmental challenges of tomorrow. To do that, we have ramped up our work on strategic foresight, scanning the horizon for emerging threats to the planet. This process culminated in the development of Navigating New Horizons – A Global Foresight Report on Planetary Health and Human Wellbeing, which was published earlier this year.  Produced in collaboration with the International Science Council, it examined eight global shifts accelerating the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste.

Is Technology Toxic?
Environmental damage is one of the most direct ways technology manifests its toxicity. Moreover, the manufacturing processes for electronic components expose workers to toxic substances, potentially leading to serious health issues. 

Electronic devices contain hazardous materials like lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic. When improperly disposed of, these substances can leach into the soil and water, causing significant environmental harm. In 2019 alone, the world generated an estimated 53.6 million tonnes of e-waste, but only a small fraction received proper recycling treatment. 

In addition, extracting rare earth metals and other materials necessary for electronic devices often leads to land, water, and air pollution. Mining activities can result in habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, and the spread of toxic wastes. For instance, producing a single smartphone can require up to 3,190 gallons of water. 

Beyond physical health and environmental impact, technology also introduces a form of toxicity that affects social interactions and mental health. The term "digital toxicity" encompasses the adverse effects of prolonged and unsupervised use of digital media and devices. Issues such as digital addiction, cyberbullying, and the spread of misinformation are prevalent, with significant impacts on mental health and societal harmony. 

Impact Type	Description	Estimated Annual Cost (£)
E-waste	Toxic materials leaching into ecosystems	2.5 billion
Carbon Emissions	Emissions from non-renewable energy sources used in tech	3 billion
Health Issues	Conditions caused by chemical exposure in manufacturing	1 billion
Are Technological Products Degradable?
Most technology products are composed of metals, plastics, and electronic components. Metals can often be recycled, but the plastics used in tech are typically non-biodegradable. These plastics may take hundreds of years to break down, releasing toxic substances into the environment. 

Annually, the world generates between 20 to 50 million metric tons of e-waste, a significant portion of which is in landfills or improperly disposed of in developing countries.

The production of smartphones, for example, is a significant contributor to carbon dioxide emissions, with a Deloitte report indicating that smartphones generated 146 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2022 alone. The materials required for these devices, such as lithium, neodymium, and antimony, are scarce and contribute to the carbon footprint during mining and manufacturing. 

For instance, a staggering 80% of a smartphone's carbon footprint is attributed to its production, with only 16% accounted for by its use during its lifetime. The remaining emissions are from transportation, getting the product from supplier to consumer. Once discarded, less than 16% of electronic waste is recycled.

The IT sector significantly contributes to global carbon emissions, particularly through data centres and network infrastructure which are energy-intensive

Despite the grim scenario, advancements in green technology offer a glimmer of hope. For instance, researchers are developing biodegradable polymers that can significantly reduce the environmental impact of disposed electronics.

The stark reality is that most technological products are not readily degradable, posing a substantial challenge to environmental sustainability.

Is Technology Sustainable?
Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort towards sustainable technology practices. However, for technology to be truly sustainable, industries must embrace circular economy models that prioritise resource efficiency and waste reduction.

Adopting a circular economy model, where resources are reused and recycled, is becoming a focus for many tech companies. This approach reduces the dependency on raw materials and decreases overall environmental impacts.

Globally, the push towards sustainable tech is gaining momentum. The recycling of e-waste is a growing industry, valued at approximately £43 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach around £50 billion by 2026.

The balance between these aspects will define the future of technology's sustainability. While it continues to advance, its environmental impact must be addressed.

Can Technological Products Be Recycled?
Initiatives are underway to tackle the growing tech-waste concern. The UN reports that only a fraction of e-waste is properly collected and recycled, highlighting the need for improved consumer education and recycling infrastructure. 

For instance, innovations like smart waste bins and sensors streamline the collection process, while artificial intelligence improves sorting efficiency. However, adopting such technologies faces hurdles, including high costs and competition from cheaper virgin materials.

Environmental Impact Compared to Everyday Things
The tech industry's carbon footprint is substantial and growing. Digital technology accounts for 3.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, increasing by about 6% annually. To put this into perspective, let's compare it to everyday activities and items:

Sending a short email from a phone generates 0.2g of CO2e, while the same email sent from a laptop doubles the emissions to 0.4g.
A long email, crafted over 10 minutes and sent to 100 people, can produce 29g of CO2e.
Using a smartphone for an hour daily results in 70kg of CO2e annually. 
When we look beyond our gadgets, the environmental impact of other daily activities becomes apparent:

A 250g raw steak from deforested land in Brazil carries a carbon footprint of 17.8kg CO2e.
An 800g loaf of locally produced and sold bread has a footprint of 630g CO2e, increasing to 1kg if transported extensively by road.
A 5-watt low-energy bulb used for a year results in 28kg of CO2e, while a 100-watt incandescent bulb skyrockets this to 570kg CO2e
Globally, mobile phone usage contributes a staggering 580 million tons of CO2e annually. The average person's annual carbon footprint is around 7 tons of CO2e. The data underscores the need for a worldwide shift towards more sustainable technology use.

Understanding the environmental impact of our digital habits is crucial. We can significantly reduce our carbon footprint by making informed choices, such as optimising email use or switching to energy-efficient bulbs. 

As consumers, we hold the power to drive change, demanding greener practices from tech companies and reducing our reliance on energy-intensive devices.
