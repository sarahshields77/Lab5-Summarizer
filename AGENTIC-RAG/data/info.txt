Software Engineering
Software engineering is a systematic approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It encompasses requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and maintenance, with a focus on quality and efficiency.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG combines the strengths of information retrieval systems with generative AI models. The retrieved data enhances factual grounding, reducing hallucinations in generated outputs.
